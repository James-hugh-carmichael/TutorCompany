                        My journey began in secondary school, where I found that being tutored by university students made all the difference. 
                        They weren’t just tutors; they were mentors who understood the challenges I faced and helped me gradually transition into university life. 
                        Inspired by their support, I decided to create a space where current university students can pass on their knowledge, making education more relatable, engaging
                        and tailored to your needs
