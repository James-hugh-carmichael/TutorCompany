                My journey began in secondary school, where I found that being tutored by university students made all the difference. They weren’t just tutors; they were mentors who understood the challenges I faced and helped me gradually transition into university life. Inspired by their support, I decided to create a space where current university students can pass on their knowledge, making education more relatable, engaging, and tailored to your needs.

                <div>I made this site having been fed up of hidden fees, not being able to work on my own schedule and only getting a small amount of money that I charged when tutoring.
                    I believe putting you guys first, making signing up easy and a free DBS check on us if you are successful in interview.</div>
